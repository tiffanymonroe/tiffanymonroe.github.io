## Fandom Trivia
# GA WDI-R Gizmo Project 1

## The Technology
Fandom Trivia uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The site mainly uses JS and jQuery to store questions, alternate players, and determine rounds, winners, losers, and ties. The modal--with the help of my classmate Alex Alday--displays questions and choices, depending on which category the player chooses.

## The Approach
I wanted to create a trivia game for members of different fandoms. My approach was to get a working game, then go back and add both categories and more questions per category. My first step was to pseudocode how the game would run, from a player perspective. Once I understood the players' POV, I tried to figure out the best way to store the data. I decided on a category object that would hold all the categories, plus their questions, possible choices, and answers in arrays. I found that getting the data to the site was the most difficult part of the game. I struggled to get it to run. The iterations just wouldn't work. In the end, though, I was able to get a functioning game that brings some random fandoms together.

## The Future
There are several things I'd continue working on, if I had more time. I'd like to fix the modal, so that you can't put multiple choices on one modal. I wasn't happy with having to hard code the categories. I know there's a better way to organize it. Because it took me so long to get the iterations to print on the site--they worked in the console--I'd also like to go back to structure it into a more robust game. Alas.
